# Description

An attempt to provide a language and editor agnostic solution for doing
literate programming.

**NOTE: This is a work in progress, any feedback, ideas or pull requests are
welcome!**

# Tangle and Weave

The project is and the code is maintained with emacs and org-mode, thus you can
open the .org file and export the document in any format you like or tangel the
code again yourself.
Or you can use pdflatex/texi2dvi/xelatex or other tools to either produce a
PDF from the available .tex file or a document in another format.

# Contribute

If you want to contribute you should at least be familiar with emacs, org-mode
and latex.
